I began working with technology in September of 2016 and found a strong curiosity for how our processes work. Working in FINTECH means I work closely with merchants and technology to move money between banks. After familiarizing myself with the basics and working closely with our developers, I found programming to be a useful skill that could further my career. After taking the pre-course through Flatiron School, I knew this was something I wanted to dive into and so signed up for the full stack web development program. Currently I am about a month into my journey and looking forward to learning and growing as time goes by.
